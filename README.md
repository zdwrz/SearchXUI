# SearchXUI



## Introducation
* Search all files under a specific folder using a keyword. Files now support microsoftword and text. Technically support all file types supported by Apache Tika.
* JavaFX is needed for this project.

## Usage

* mvn package will generate a execution jar.

* Run by passing --version=old will use the old implementation which is not showing result until the whole searching is done.
* Run by passing --version=new or by default, the application will run in real time mode which showing the result file immediately when found match.
